/**
 * KeyVault Status Types
 *
 * Types describing the health, quota, and verification state of a stored
 * BYOK key — surfaced in the KeyVault Accounts detail panel and the KeyVault
 * wizard's "validation results" / "quota display" steps. These apply to any
 * BYOK key (degraded health, quota snapshot, mid-verification Cursor
 * session tokens, etc.).
 *
 * Note: `QuotaSnapshot` is the flat wire format emitted by the legacy
 * `KeyValidationResponse`. The newer BYOK RPC validation path returns
 * `QuotaInfo` (see `@src/api/types/keys`) which carries a `usage_items`
 * array instead. The two shapes are not interchangeable; reconciling them
 * is deferred until the wire-format unification pass.

 * environment overrides alongside the API key — base URLs, custom
 * headers, etc. The wizard's `useKeyValidation` hook collects these so
 * the saved key record can write them to the local key store.
