/**
 * Project store types — wire shape for `project_*` Tauri commands.
 *
 * These mirror the Rust types in `src-tauri/src/project_management/projects/types/`.
 * The store is global (rooted at `~/.orgii/projects/projects.db`) and slug-keyed.
 * No `repoPath` — projects are addressed by their stable slug.
