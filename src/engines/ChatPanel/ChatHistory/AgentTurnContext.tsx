/**
 * AgentTurnContext
 *
 * Per-group context that exposes turn-scoped actions (regenerate, etc.)
 * to the activity event renderer tree below `ChatItemRenderer`.
 *
 * Why context and not prop drill:
 *   - Registry-based lazy components (`getChatLazyComponent`) only accept
 *     `event` + `itemIndex`. Threading extra props through the registry
 *     would pollute the generic event-component contract.
 *   - "Regenerate" is a per-turn action, scoped to one group. The sticky
 *     header of that group (the user message) already lives in
 *     `ChatHistory`; context is the cleanest way to bind the turn-level
 *     callback to its descendants without widening every renderer signature.
 *   - Same shape will host future per-turn actions (copy turn, reply-to,
 *     share turn) without repeated prop-drill work.
 *
 * Consumer rules:
 *   - Only the event component that renders the *final* assistant message
 *     of a completed turn should surface the regenerate affordance.
 *     `isLastAssistantFlatIndex` is the flat index (within `ChatHistory`'s
 *     `flatItems`) of the turn's last assistant_message event. Consumers
 *     compare their own `itemIndex` against it.
 *   - When the agent is still streaming the turn, or when there is no
 *     assistant message in the group yet, `isLastAssistantFlatIndex` is
 *     `null` and consumers must not render the button.
