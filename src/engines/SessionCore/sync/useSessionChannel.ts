/**
 * useSessionChannel — Tauri IPC Channel subscription for session events
 *
 * Subscribes to the Rust backend's ChannelRegistry for a specific session_id.
 * Events are delivered via Tauri's IPC Channel mechanism, replacing raw
 * WebSocket connections for session-scoped events.
 *
 * On mount: invokes `subscribe_session_events` with a Channel callback.
 *   The backend returns a unique `channelId` for this registration.
 * On unmount: invokes `unsubscribe_session_events` with the exact
 *   `channelId`, so only THIS channel is removed — other channels for the
 *   same session (from a concurrent re-mount) are not affected.
 *
 * ## Race-condition hardening
 *
 * Three failure shapes are explicitly defended against:
 *
 *   1. **Cleanup before subscribe resolves.** A fast session switch
 *      can fire the cleanup function before the backend has assigned a
 *      `channelId`. We chain the unsubscribe onto the subscribe promise
 *      so we always have the correct id to send, even if it arrives
 *      after the React effect is gone.
 *
 *   2. **Late events on a stale channel.** Tauri may deliver a message
 *      on the OLD channel between the time we call `unsubscribe_session_events`
 *      and the time the backend actually processes it. Without
 *      gating, those messages would be forwarded to the CURRENT
 *      `onEvent` (which is updated via a ref), so a session-A event
 *      could end up applied to session-B's adapter. We gate every
 *      message through a per-effect `destroyed` flag that is set
 *      synchronously in cleanup, so post-cleanup deliveries are
 *      dropped cleanly.
 *
 *   3. **Silent unsubscribe failures.** The previous implementation
 *      swallowed unsubscribe rejections with `.catch(() => {})`,
 *      hiding diagnostic information when the backend refused the
 *      call (registry mismatch, dead session, transport error). We
 *      log a warning so the leak — if any — is at least visible in
 *      the console.
 *
 * The race-condition logic itself is exposed as
 * {@link SessionChannelLifecycle} so it can be unit-tested without a
 * React renderer.
