/**
 * Stream text accumulator helpers.
 *
 * Live stream transports are intended to send delta fragments, but reconnects,
 * provider retries, and mixed CLI/Rust paths can occasionally replay already
 * delivered text or send a cumulative snapshot. A blind `current + incoming`
 * then renders duplicated assistant text. This helper preserves normal fragment
 * appends while making accumulation idempotent for common replay/snapshot cases.
 */

/**
 * Merge an incoming stream payload into the currently displayed content.
 *
 * Handles common cases:
 * - normal fragment:              "Hello " + "world"       -> "Hello world"
 * - cumulative snapshot:          "Hello" + "Hello world"  -> "Hello world"
 * - meaningful exact/tail replay: "The assistant starts here" + same text -> unchanged
 * - overlapping replay tail:      "A long prefix..." + "prefix...tail" -> merged tail
