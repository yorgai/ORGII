/**
 * usePlanningIndicator Hook
 *
 * Shows a single "Planning next step..." line in the chat panel when:
 * 1. Any session type is actively working (code / cloud / OS agent)
 * 2. No store mutations for IDLE_THRESHOLD_MS (1 second)
 * 3. No event currently has displayStatus === "running"
 *
 * The indicator stays visible until new events arrive or the session ends.
 *
 * After PLANNING_SLOW_HINT_MS (10s) with the indicator still visible,
 * `showSlowHint` becomes true (e.g. "Taking longer than usual.") — UNLESS
 * the most recent chat-visible event is already a settled assistant message,
 * in which case the slow hint is suppressed. From the user's point of view
 * the agent has just finished talking; promoting the footer to "taking
 * longer than usual" while the turn executor is doing its post-batch
 * "anything else?" LLM round trip is misleading. The base indicator itself
 * is NOT suppressed in that state: mid-turn the agent routinely narrates
 * (settled assistant message) and then thinks for seconds before the next
 * tool call, and hiding the footer there reads as a frozen UI.
 *
 * Watchdog: if the indicator stays visible for PLANNING_WATCHDOG_MS (60s),
 * we assume Rust dropped `agent:complete` (or `agent:queue_status` idle)
 * and force `sessionRuntimeStatusAtom` to `completed` so the UI cannot stay
 * stuck on "Planning next step..." forever. Logged as a warning because
 * this should only fire on genuine event-loss bugs.
 *
 * Reads directly from derivedSnapshotAtom (NOT eventsAtom). During streaming,
 * Rust pushes StreamingSnapshot which has no `events` field, causing eventsAtom
 * to return []. Both snapshot types now carry `hasRunningEvent` (computed
 * against ALL events, including non-chat-visible ones like thinking deltas).
 *
 * Uses snapshot `version` as the activity token — it bumps on every store
 * mutation (upsert, append, merge), including streaming deltas for thinking
 * and assistant messages. This avoids iterating chatEvents for text length.
 *
 * Cold-start optimisation: when isSessionActive first becomes true (e.g. the
 * user just sent a message and the agent has not produced its first event
 * yet), `idleAfterVersion` is seeded synchronously from `version` in a
 * useEffect with a stable activation ref, so the indicator is visible on
 * the very next paint without waiting IDLE_THRESHOLD_MS. Any subsequent
 * store mutation bumps `version`, breaking the equality and re-arming the
 * full 1-second delay to prevent flicker between tool calls. (An earlier
 * version used `setTimeout(0)` here, but that could race with the agent's
 * first event and leave the indicator hidden for several seconds on very
 * cold starts.)
