/**
 * Types - Main Barrel Export
 *
 * Centralized export point for all application types.
 * Reorganized by domain: core, session, editor, git, testing, ui
 *
 * Note: Due to duplicate type names across modules, we don't use `export *`.
 * Import directly from specific modules instead:
 *
 * @example
 * // Direct imports (recommended)
 * import { Session } from "@src/types/session/session";
 * import { GitFile } from "@src/types/git/types";
 * import { UserProfileData } from "@src/types/core/user";
 *
 * // Or use namespace imports to avoid conflicts
 * import * as SessionTypes from "@src/types/session/session";
 * import * as GitTypes from "@src/types/git/types";
 * import * as CoreTypes from "@src/types/core";
