/**
 * Services Layer - Singleton APIs
 *
 * These services provide capabilities shared by both AI and UI.
 * They are the single source of truth for operations.
 *
 * Architecture:
 *   Services → Tauri/Backend APIs + Jotai Atoms
 *   Actions → Services (registered at app init)
 *   UI → dispatch(action) or Service.method()
