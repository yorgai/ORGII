/**
 * `useCallbackRefEffect` — run an effect when a DOM element is
 * attached, and tear it down when the element is detached.
 *
 * ## Problem this solves
 *
 * The canonical "attach a side effect to an element" pattern in React is:
 *
 *   ```tsx
 *   const ref = useRef<HTMLDivElement | null>(null);
 *   useEffect(() => {
 *     const el = ref.current;
 *     if (!el) return;
 *     el.addEventListener("scroll", onScroll);
 *     return () => el.removeEventListener("scroll", onScroll);
 *   }, [onScroll]);
 *   return <div ref={ref}>…</div>;
 *   ```
 *
 * This works **only if the ref'd element is in the JSX tree on the
 * first effect run**. The instant the element is conditional —
 * `isCollapsed ? null : <div ref={ref}>…</div>` is the most common
 * shape — the pattern silently breaks:
 *
 *   1. First render: `isCollapsed = true`, the `<div>` isn't rendered,
 *      so `ref.current` is `null`.
 *   2. The effect runs, sees `null`, bails out.
 *   3. User toggles → `<div>` mounts and `ref.current` is populated.
 *   4. **The effect never re-runs**, because `ref.current` isn't in
 *      the dependency array (and even if it were, refs don't trigger
 *      re-renders).
 *   5. The listener is never attached. The bug is invisible until a
 *      user reports "scrolling doesn't auto-hide the scrollbar after
 *      I expand this block".
 *
 * `useCallbackRefEffect` fixes this by using React's callback-ref
 * idiom under the hood. The "ref" you attach to your JSX is a
 * function, not a mutable ref object. React calls it with the
 * element when it mounts, and with `null` when it unmounts (or when
 * the element identity changes). We turn those callbacks into a
 * deterministic "setup / teardown" pair that runs at exactly the
 * right time, regardless of when the element actually appears in
 * the tree.
 *
 * ## Returned value
 *
 * The hook returns a stable ref-callback. Use it as `ref={...}` on
 * the JSX element you care about. You may apply the same callback
 * to multiple sibling elements; the setup runs once per `attach`
 * call, and tearing down for an element that wasn't attached is a
 * no-op.
 *
 * The callback identity is stable across renders, so passing it to
 * `ref={...}` will not trigger an "attach → detach → attach" cycle
 * on every render. (Inline `ref={(el) => …}` does that and is the
 * other half of why people avoid callback refs.)
 *
 * ## Effect lifecycle
 *
 * The `setup(element)` function may return a cleanup function. The
 * cleanup runs:
 *   - When the element unmounts (React calls the ref-callback with
 *     `null`).
 *   - When the hook is unmounted while the element is still attached.
 *   - When `deps` change (re-running setup/cleanup, same as
 *     `useEffect`).
 *
 * `setup` is called with the *current* element; it is never called
 * with `null`. If the element is never attached, `setup` is never
 * called and cleanup is therefore never needed.
 *
 * ## Comparison to common alternatives
 *
 *   - `useEffect` + `useRef`: works only if the element is in the
 *     initial render.
 *   - `useLayoutEffect` + `useRef`: same limitation, just earlier
 *     in the commit phase.
 *   - Inline callback ref `ref={el => { … }}`: identity changes
 *     every render → attach/detach storm.
 *   - `useMemo(() => (el: T | null) => { … }, [deps])`: no way to
 *     express the cleanup half cleanly, and `deps`-driven re-runs
 *     fight against the ref-callback lifecycle.
 *
 * `useCallbackRefEffect` packages the correct interaction once.
 *
 * @example Scroll listener on a conditional element
 * ```tsx
 * const refCb = useCallbackRefEffect<HTMLDivElement>(
 *   (el) => {
 *     const onScroll = () => setIsScrolling(true);
 *     el.addEventListener("scroll", onScroll, { capture: true });
 *     return () => el.removeEventListener("scroll", onScroll, { capture: true });
 *   },
 *   []
 * );
 *
 * return isCollapsed ? null : <div ref={refCb}>…</div>;
 * ```
 *
 * @example Animation loop scoped to element presence
 * ```tsx
 * const refCb = useCallbackRefEffect<HTMLDivElement>(
 *   (el) => {
 *     const id = setInterval(() => runAnimation(el), 2200);
 *     return () => clearInterval(id);
 *   },
 *   [enabled]
 * );
 * ```
