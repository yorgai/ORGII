/**
 * Pure routing-rule preview shared by `AgentTeamWizard` and `OrgDetailView`.

 * This is a TS mirror of `AgentOrgRunContext::check_routing` in
 * `src-tauri/src/agent_core/core/coordination/agent_org_runs.rs`. The
 * Rust side is the runtime source of truth — `org_send_message`
 * enforces these rules at send time. This module exists so the
 * wizard can show users a Strict-mode reachability preview *before*
 * anything launches, and surface "isolated member" warnings while
 * the org is being edited.
 *
 * Parity invariant: every rule branch here has a corresponding
 * `routing_strict_*` test in `agent_org_runs::tests`. If the Rust
 * rules change, the matching parity test in this folder will fail
 * and force the two implementations to be re-synced.
