Need a singleton promise pattern.\n   - The `login()` function in `AuthContext` directly calls the API instead of going through a service layer, making it hard to test.\n   - Session expiry handling is scattered — some components check `isTokenExpired()` inline, others rely on the axios interceptor.\n\n3. **Proposed approach**:\n   - Extract all token management into a dedicated `AuthService` class with a lock-based refresh mechanism.\n   - Consolidate the context to be a thin React wrapper around `AuthService`.\n   - Add a `useRequireAuth()` hook that redirects to login if the session is invalid, replacing the ad-hoc checks.\n\nLet me start by reading the existing files to confirm my understanding before proposing specific changes.",
