/**
 * Internal built-in agents that must never appear in user-facing pickers
 * or the tool-matrix.
 *
 * Two buckets:
 * 1. Delegation primitives (`builtin:explore`, `builtin:general`) — owned
 *    by the runtime (`agent_tool` schema fallback). Always reachable from
 *    every parent regardless of its `subAgents` list, so listing them in a
 *    picker would create a ghost knob.
 * 2. Internal templates / memory subsystem (`builtin:base`,
 *    `builtin:memory-extractor`, `builtin:memory-consolidator`) —
 *    inheritance scaffolding and background workers, never delegated to
 *    from a parent agent.
 *
 * Mirror of `SUBAGENT_FORBIDDEN_IDS` in
 * `src-tauri/crates/agent-core/src/core/definitions/builtin/mod.rs`.
 * Keep these two lists in sync whenever a new internal agent is added.
