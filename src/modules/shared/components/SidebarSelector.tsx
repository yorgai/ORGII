/**
 * Sidebar Selector Component
 *
 * All sidebars stay mounted to prevent DOM destroy/recreate on route
 * switches (which causes a layout bounce). The inactive sidebar is hidden
 * with `display: none`; the active one renders inside a thin flex-item
 * wrapper (flexShrink: 0) so SidebarBase keeps its resize handle in the
 * correct stacking context.
 *
 * NOTE: `display: contents` was removed because it broke the resize handle
 * in WebKit — the handle's absolutely-positioned hit area lost reliable
 * pointer events when its nearest box-generating ancestor was skipped.
