/**
 * Active-selection gating for multi-section replay sidebars.
 *
 * Some session-replay sidebars (currently the Code Editor's `FileSidebar`)
 * carry several independent `selectedXxxEventId` values — one per op kind —
 * and render each in its own tree section. Only ONE of those selections is
 * actually mirrored in the main pane (CodePanel) at any given moment, so we
 * want exactly one section to show the `primary-1` row fill and the rest to
 * appear un-selected, even if they still remember a prior click.
 *
 * This module owns the type + the helper that does that gating so the sidebar
 * component itself stays free of per-kind ternaries, and any future multi-kind
 * sidebar can opt in with a single import.
 *
 * The blue "agent cursor" dot is a separate signal (driven by `agentSelectedIds`
 * in the sidebar) and is NOT affected by this module.
