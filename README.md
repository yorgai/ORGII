It is not just another AI coding tool; it is an experiment in human/agent organizations and org-level alignment. Agents are getting better, but collaboration, observability, structure, and shared accountability are not keeping up — and in some cases are getting worse. Cursor, Claude Code, and similar tools often treat agents as outsourced assistants: useful for output, but hard to audit, coordinate, align, or evolve at a system level.

ORG-II explores a different model: agents as persistent, observable colleagues inside a structured organization. Instead of stateless, hard-to-review AI IDE sessions, it introduces replayable agent execution, cross-session memory, AI blame, and a local-first Rust-based runtime so humans, agents, and teams can collaborate around shared context and aligned goals.

## Key capabilities

- Long-running sessions with replayable execution traces for auditing, review, and debugging.
- Rust-based agents that work with your existing API keys and agent subscriptions.
- GUI, CLI, terminal, Git, browser, LSP, timeline, and database tooling.
- Cross-session memory, cross-agent knowledge sharing, and shared workspace state.
- Resource-aware execution that can react to CPU, RAM, and human attention availability.
- Agent-powered GUI end-to-end testing for supervised self-evolution.
- Scheduling and auto-started sessions so agents can run overnight or continue work when you are away.
- Org-level alignment surfaces (issues/projects management) for coordinating humans, agents, goals, and accountability (WIP).
- Session collaboration and group issue workflows via self-hosted Supabase (WIP).

## Develop from source

To build or contribute from source:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run download:sidecars
pnpm run tauri:dev
```

For more contribution details, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). We ask everyone to be respectful and empathetic; see [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Optional native sidecars

Browser Use and Computer Use features rely on optional native helpers for browser automation and macOS screen automation:

- `agent-browser` is downloaded from `vercel-labs/agent-browser` releases for the current OS/CPU.
- `peekaboo` is downloaded from `steipete/peekaboo` releases on macOS.

Computer Use is currently available on macOS only. Browser Use can use `agent-browser` on supported platforms.

If a sidecar is missing, the Rust build creates a small placeholder resource so development builds can continue. The related capability may fall back to `PATH` or remain unavailable until you run `pnpm run download:sidecars`.
