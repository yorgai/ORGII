//! Debug-only test endpoints for the `/agent/test/*` route tree.
//!
//! Split by theme so each file stays under the per-file budget and
//! owns one cohesive slice of the E2E surface. Public handlers live
//! in `api::agent::public`; everything here is **never** compiled into
//! release builds — the parent module gates `mod test` itself with
//! `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]`, so no inner gating is needed here.
