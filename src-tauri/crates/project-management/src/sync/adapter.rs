//! `SyncAdapter` trait + supporting types.
//!
//! Adapters implement four operations:
//! - [`SyncAdapter::push`] — flush one outbox row to the external system.
//! - [`SyncAdapter::pull`] — fetch external changes since a cursor.
//! - [`SyncAdapter::handle_conflict`] — adapter-specific tie-breaker
//!   when the generic field-mtime resolver can't decide.
//! - [`SyncAdapter::entity_field_map`] — declarative `WorkItem` ↔
//!   external API field correspondence so the resolver stays generic.
//!
//! Adapters never touch the DB directly — the worker takes care of
//! persistence around each call. This keeps adapters easy to unit-test
//! and prevents adapter-specific schema drift.
