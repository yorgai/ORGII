//! Lineage Module — Chat Session Impact Graph
//!
//! Tracks which files, functions, and commits were influenced by an AI chat
//! session. Two-phase design:
//!
//! 1. **Provenance** (write-time): when an AI session edits a file, AST nodes
//!    in the edited range are extracted via tree-sitter and stored with the
//!    session ID in `node_provenance`.
//!
//! 2. **Commit tracking** (commit-time): when a git commit is created, its
//!    diff hunks are matched against provenance entries by line-range overlap,
//!    and matches are recorded in `commit_lineage`.
//!
//! 3. **Analytics**: `get_session_impact()` queries both tables to produce a
//!    summary of files touched, functions created, and commits influenced.
