//! Performance Optimization Module
//!
//! Provides Rust-accelerated implementations for performance-critical operations:
//! - Image luminance calculation (for adaptive UI theming)
//! - Binary file detection (SIMD-accelerated)
//! - Large JSON parsing (simd-json)
//! - Hash computation (SHA-256)
//! - Diff computation and fuzzy patch application
//! - Process metrics collection (memory, CPU usage)
