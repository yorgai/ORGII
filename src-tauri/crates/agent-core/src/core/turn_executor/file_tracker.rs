//! File content tracker for stale-edit detection.
//!
//! After a `read_file`, the tracker records a hash of the file's CONTENT.
//! Before a file-modifying tool (`edit_file` / `apply_patch` / `delete_file`)
//! runs, it checks the file's content hash still matches; if an external
//! process changed the content, the edit is rejected with a re-read request.
//!
//! ## Why content hash, not mtime
//!
//! The previous implementation compared `mtime`. That produced **false stale
//! rejections**: any process that merely touches a file (an editor save with
//! no change, a backup/mirror copy, an `atime`/`mtime` bump, sub-second
//! `SystemTime` precision jitter on a same-second read→write) advances `mtime`
//! without changing content, so a strict `current > recorded` comparison fired
//! even though the bytes were identical. mtime is only a *proxy* for "did the
//! content change"; hashing the content answers that question directly — no
//! tolerance window, no precision pitfalls, and it still catches genuine
//! external edits (different bytes → different hash).
//!
//! ## Performance: stat fast path
//!
//! Hashing is O(file size) and both the per-turn history seed and the
//! per-iteration changed-files scan touch EVERY tracked file. Doing full
//! content hashing there caused multi-second stalls in long sessions.
//! Each entry therefore also records `(mtime, len)`:
//! - unchanged stat → assumed fresh, no bytes read (µs per file);
//! - changed stat with a recorded hash → hash to confirm (mtime-only
//!   touches stay non-stale, preserving the hash semantics above);
//! - changed stat without a recorded hash (history-seeded entries, whose
//!   baseline was stat-only by design) → treated as changed.
