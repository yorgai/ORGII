// Session Status
// ============================================

/// Current status of an agent session (application level).
///
/// This is the full-fidelity status used by the application layer for:
/// - UI display
/// - Session lifecycle management
/// - Frontend state synchronization
///
/// ## Relationship with `AgentSessionStatus`
///
/// The `AgentSessionStatus` in `persistence::db_helpers` is a simplified subset
/// (5 states vs 11 here) used for database storage. This design:
/// - Reduces DB schema complexity
/// - Maps detailed states (Pending, WaitingForUser, etc.) to coarser DB states
/// - Allows application-level state transitions without DB migrations
///
/// When persisting, application code should map this to `AgentSessionStatus`.
