//! Manual-compact orchestration.
//!
//! Ports `hermes-agent/gateway/run.py:_handle_compress_command`
//! (lines 6226-6321) to Orgii. Runs a real LLM-based context compaction
//! for a channel-attached session on user demand, then forks into a
//! fresh versioned session id (same semantics as idle reset), exactly
//! like what
//! the auto-compact path in `processor.rs:908-971` does when the
//! context-window trip-wire fires.
//!
//! Call flow:
//! 1. Look up the bound agent session by `session_id` (must exist in
//!    the in-memory pool — manual compact requires a live runtime so
//!    we have a provider + compaction config to work with).
//! 2. Load the persisted transcript via
//!    `persistence::load_llm_history(session_id)`.
//! 3. Bail early if the transcript is too short to meaningfully compress
//!    (< 4 messages, matching Hermes).
//! 4. Run `ContextCompactor::compact(...)` with the session's own
//!    runtime provider + model + compaction config + compaction state.
//! 5. Run `post_compact_cleanup` on the output (same cleanup the
//!    processor applies after auto-compact).
//! 6. Call `compact_fork::attempt_fork(compacted, old_sid)` to mint the
//!    new session, persist the compacted transcript there, archive the
//!    old, rebind the chat, queue the user-facing notice.
//! 7. Return a `ManualCompactSummary` so the slash handler can reply
//!    with the Hermes-style headline: message count before/after +
//!    token estimate before/after.
//!
//! # Divergences from Hermes
//!
//! - Hermes's `_handle_compress_command` spins up a throwaway
//!   `AIAgent` to run the compactor (because their compactor is an
//!   instance method); we reuse the existing session's runtime because
//!   `ContextCompactor::compact` is a free function. Net effect is the
//!   same — same provider, same model, same `protect_first_n` budget.
//! - Hermes accepts an optional `focus_topic` argument to guide the
//!   summariser. We do NOT accept one in MVP — Orgii's compactor has no
//!   matching hook yet. The slash parser drops any argument. Tracked
//!   as future work; see the MVP decision in the design doc.
//! - Hermes returns token estimates via
//!   `estimate_messages_tokens_rough`; we use
//!   `ContextCompactor::estimate_messages_tokens` (tokenizer-backed)
//!   because it's already a public helper and gives better numbers
//!   for the user reply line.
