//! Fast-path check: skip re-init if the existing runtime already matches.
//!
//! Many init calls are re-entrant — channel re-inject, scheduled cron tick,
//! tool dispatch from a sub-agent. The first call did the expensive work
//! (provider construction, MCP startup, plugin scan); the rest just need to
//! confirm "this runtime is still right for what you're asking".
//!
//! Match criteria are deliberately conservative:
//!   - account: must match exactly (None==None or Some(a)==Some(a))
//!   - model: only checked when the caller pinned one (no pin → accept anything)
//!   - workspace: the runtime's live `working_dir()` must match the
//!     caller's resolved workspace path. Identity resolution projects a
//!     worktree session onto its working dir, so comparing against
//!     `working_dir()` (NOT the stable `user_visible()` root) keeps
//!     worktree sessions on the fast path instead of rebuilding the
//!     runtime on every message.
//!
//! The model rule is the load-bearing one: when the channel re-injects an
//! inbound message, it does NOT know which model the user picked, so it
//! passes `None`. We must accept the existing runtime in that case rather
//! than failing on an empty model field.
