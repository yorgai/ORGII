//! Skills loader for the agent.
//!
//! Skills are markdown files (`SKILL.md`) with optional YAML frontmatter
//! that extend the agent's capabilities. They are progressively loaded:
//! a summary is included in the system prompt, and the full content
//! is loaded on demand when the agent reads the skill file.

// `loader::*` flat re-exports are needed because `generate_handler!` in
// `src/commands/handler_list.inc` resolves Tauri commands at the
// `agent_core::skills::loader::<name>` path (function + matching
// `__cmd__<name>`). Anything that is NOT a Tauri command and is not used
// flat by callers is reached via the deeper submodule (`bundled_files::*`,
// `commands::*`) — we keep those off the flat surface.
