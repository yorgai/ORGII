//! Extract Memories — background post-turn hook that runs a forked agent to
//! extract durable workspace memories from the conversation transcript.
//!
//! # Internal layout
//!
//! - **`state`** — `ExtractMemoriesState` struct + read-only
//!   `ExtractMemoriesStateSnapshot` for debug/E2E endpoints. The mutable
//!   fields are `pub(super)` so only the gating helpers and the runner can
//!   mutate them.
//! - **`gating`** — `should_extract`, `skip_if_main_agent_wrote_memory`,
//!   `stash_pending`, `take_pending`, `record_turn`, plus the cursor /
//!   memory-write inspection helpers.
//! - **`runner`** — `run_extraction` (the forked-agent invocation),
//!   prompt building, and the allow-list tool policy.
//!
//! `NoopEventHandler` lives here at the directory-module root because it is
//! shared with `auto_dream`, which imports it as
//! `super::extract::NoopEventHandler`.
