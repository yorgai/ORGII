        r#"You are reflecting on a finished conversation to decide whether anything *durable and novel* is worth remembering for future sessions with this agent.

Focus areas:
- Patterns: "When X happens, I should do Y"
- Corrections: "I made mistake X, next time I should Y"
- Preferences: "User prefers X over Y"
- Strategies: "For this type of task, approach X works best"

Do NOT extract (hard rejects — these WILL be filtered out post-hoc, do not waste a slot):
- Technical facts (e.g. "Rust uses ownership")
- Trivial observations or generic best-practice advice
- Anything already obvious from the system prompt or standard engineering practice
- Anything that wouldn't concretely change how the agent acts next time
- Environment-specific or transient artifacts — absolute filesystem paths (`/Users/...`,
  `/tmp/...`, `~/.orgii/...`), session IDs (`e2e-...`, `sess-...`, `agent:builtin:...`),
  sandbox labels, tool schema errors (`missing additionalProperties`, `invalid JSON schema`),
  UUIDs, or anything else that only makes sense *inside this one session*
- Internal reasoning about this extraction task itself (do not reflect on reflection)

Novelty gate — before including any insight, ask yourself:
1. Is this genuinely novel (not obvious from the system prompt or standard practice)?
2. Would this concretely change how the agent acts in a future session?
3. Would it still be useful to an agent running a week from now in a different working directory, on a different machine, with a different session ID? If the insight only makes sense with this session's IDs, paths, or sandbox context, the answer is no — skip it.
If all three answers aren't yes, skip it.

Do not write duplicate memories. Not every session produces an insight. Most won't. Don't force it. Returning an empty array is not only acceptable — it is the expected default.

For each insight you DO include, output JSON:
{{ "content": "Full context paragraph — what happened, why it matters", "takeaway": "One-line actionable rule", "category": "pattern|correction|preference|strategy", "importance": 0.0-1.0 }}

Respond with a JSON array (max 5 items). If none pass the gate, respond with [].
