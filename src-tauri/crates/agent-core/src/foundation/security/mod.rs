//! Security module for agent tool execution.
//!
//! Provides execution-time security controls that complement the
//! tool-level access policy (`ResolvedToolPolicy`):
//!
//! - **[`SecurityPolicy`]**: Command allowlisting, pipeline validation,
//!   risk classification, path traversal prevention
//! - **[`AutonomyLevel`]**: ReadOnly / Full access modes

pub mod config;
pub mod policy;

// Items kept at the `security::` surface:
// - `SecurityPolicy`, `ValidationResult` — flat-imported by tool registration
//   and exec tool sites.
// - `AutonomyLevel`, `requires_user_confirmation` — flat-imported by
//   `core::definitions::schema` (`security::AutonomyLevel`) and the exec
//   tool (`security::requires_user_confirmation`); also referenced as
//   `super::AutonomyLevel` from sibling `config.rs`.
//
// `SecurityConfig` and `CommandRiskLevel` were flat re-exported but never
// imported as `security::<name>` anywhere; they're always reached via the
// deeper `config::` / `policy::` segment, so we no longer flatten them.
