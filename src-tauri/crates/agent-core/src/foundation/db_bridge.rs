//! Inversion-of-control bridge to the live SQLite connection getter.
//!
//! `agent_core` needs to open ad-hoc `rusqlite::Connection`s for memory,
//! consolidation, reflection, and learning subsystems, but it must compile
//! without depending on `session_persistence` (or the `database` workspace
//! crate). Same pattern as [`super::bus::event_pipeline_bridge`]:
//! the wire crate fills in a `OnceLock<fn>` slot at startup, and call sites
//! inside `agent_core` go through the public wrapper here.
//!
//! Unlike the bus bridge, an unregistered call here is not safely
//! degradable — a missing connection would silently corrupt or skip
//! persistence — so the wrapper logs at `error!` and returns
//! `rusqlite::Error::InvalidPath` instead of panicking. Callers already
//! propagate `rusqlite::Result` so the error surfaces all the way to
//! the Tauri command boundary as a normal `String` error rather than
//! aborting the process.
