//! Debug-only Tauri command: introspect the live model selection +
//! fallback chain for an active session.
//!
//! `debug_session_model_snapshot(session_id)` reports everything an
//! audit spec needs to prove the L4→L5 hop for the Models subsystem:
//!
//!   * `active_model` / `active_account_id` — what
//!     `init::build_session_runtime` ultimately passed to
//!     `providers::factory::create_provider_with_reliability`.
//!   * `resolved_selected_model_id` — `ResolvedAgent.selected_model_id`
//!     after merging the agent definition + inherited template +
//!     overrides. Equal to `active_model` whenever the caller did NOT
//!     override the model at session-launch time.
//!   * `resolved_selected_account_id` — `ResolvedAgent.selected_account_id`,
//!     same merge project.
//!   * `fallback_models` — the effective fallback chain that
//!     `ReliableProvider` iterates over, sourced from
//!     `reliability.fallback_models`.
//!
//! Mirrors `subagent_dump` and `security_dump`: the Rust command is
//! always callable; the frontend `__e2e` helper guards on
//! `debug_assertions || WEBDRIVER=1` so production users never see it.
//!
//! Intended use: an audit spec writes a sentinel `selectedModelId` to
//! the agent definition, boots a session, then asserts that the live
//! snapshot reflects exactly what was on disk *at launch time*. A
//! subsequent disk mutation must NOT alter the running session's
//! snapshot — that's the capture-at-launch invariant the Security and
//! Sub-Agents specs already pin.
