//! System Services
//!
//! OS-integration Tauri commands and helpers: macOS dock + tray + app menu,
//! NSDocumentController-backed recent files, native notifications, VPN
//! interface detection, ipinfo geolocation lookup, and host-toolchain
//! dependency probing (git, node, python, …).
//!
//! Pure leaf — no back-edges into `app`. The `#[tauri::command]` functions
//! are re-registered from `commands/handler_list.inc` via bare
//! `system_services::…` paths. Distinct from the lower-level
//! `app_platform` crate (which only ships the macOS Objective-C
//! `@try/@catch` FFI trampoline used by `agent_core` and friends).
